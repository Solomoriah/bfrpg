## Explanation of Magic Items

### Using Magic Items

To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly.

Many items are activated just by using them. For instance, a character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, wear a ring, or don a cloak. Activation of these items is generally straightforward and self-explanatory. This doesn't mean that if you use such an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such as from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.

If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.

A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Note that many magic items must be held in the hand (or otherwise specially handled or worn) to be used; the risk of accidental activation is less significant for such items.

Learning the command word for an item may be easy (sometimes the word is actually inscribed on the item) or it may be difficult, requiring the services of a powerful wizard or sage, or some other means of discovery.

Only the character holding or wearing a magic item may activate it. A character who has been gagged or silenced may not activate a magic item which requires a command word.

When an article of magic armor, clothing or jewelry (including a ring) is discovered, size is not usually an issue. Such items magically adjust themselves for wearers from as small as Halflings to as large as Humans. This effect is called **accommodation**. The GM may create "primitive" items lacking this power if he or she wishes.

Generally only one magical item of a given type may be worn at the same time. For example, a character can normally only wear one suit of armor, wear one necklace and carry one shield at a time. In the case of rings, a character may wear one magical ring per hand. If a character wears more items of a given type than would normally be practical, the items will usually fail to function due to interference with one another; for instance, wearing two rings on the same hand normally results in both rings failing to operate. **Note, however,** that this limitation cannot be used to disable cursed magic items. For example, wearing a cursed ring would prevent another magic ring from being worn and used on that hand, but the curse would not be lifted by donning a second magic ring.

### Magic Weapons

Magic weapons are created with a variety of powers and will usually aid the wielder in combat. A magical weapon's bonus is applied to all attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Casts Light on Command:** By drawing the weapon and uttering a command word, the wielder may cause it to glow; it will then shed light with the same radius as a **light** spell. Sheathing or laying down the weapon, or speaking the command word again, dispels the effect. This power may be used as often as desired.

**Charm Person:** This power allows the wielder to cast **charm person** once per day, as if by an 8^th^ level Magic-User, by brandishing the weapon, speaking a command word and gazing at the target creature. (The wielder's gaze does not have to be met for the spell to be cast.) The target creature is allowed saving throws just as described in the spell description.

**Drains Energy:** A weapon with this power drains one life energy level on a hit, as described under **Energy Drain** in the **Encounter** section; up to 2d4 levels can be drained by a weapon with this power, after which time the weapon loses this power but retains any other magical effects or bonuses.

**Flames on Command:** Upon command, the weapon will be sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until the command is given again, or until the weapon is dropped or sheathed. While it flames, all damage done by the weapon is treated as fire damage, and an additional +1 bonus (in addition to the weapon's normal bonus) is added to damage when fighting trolls, treants, and other creatures especially vulnerable to fire. It casts light and burns just as if it were a torch.

**Locate Objects:** This power allows the wielder to cast the spell **locate object** once per day, as if by an 8^th^ level Magic-User.

**Special Enemy:** These weapons are created to combat a specific sort of creature, as rolled on the Special Ability table. When used against that specific enemy, the second listed bonus applies instead of the first; so a sword +1, +3 vs. Undead would provide +1 attack and damage against giant rats, but +3 attack and damage rolls against zombies.

**Wishes:** Weapons with this power have the ability to grant 1d4 wishes. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the **Game Master** section regarding this. After these wishes have been made, the weapon loses this power, but retains any other bonuses and powers.

**Cursed Weapons** inflict a penalty to the wielder's attack rolls, as rolled on the Weapon Bonus table. The curse causes the afflicted character to be unable to get rid of the weapon. There are two possible forms the curse may take: Obsession and Affliction. The GM may decide which to use at his or her option.

**Obsession:** Regardless of how severe the penalty is, the character wielding the weapon will believe it is a bonus and refuse to use any other weapon in combat. A **remove curse** spell is the only way to rid a character of such a weapon; but as he or she will believe the weapon is the best magical weapon ever, the character receives a saving throw vs. Spells to resist.

**Affliction:** The character knows the weapon is cursed as soon as he or she uses it in combat; however, any attempt to throw it away fails, as the weapon magically appears back in the character's hand whenever he or she tries to draw any other weapon. In this case, the **remove curse** spell needed to rid the character of the weapon will be unopposed (i.e. no saving throw).

### Magic Armor

Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. In general, magic armor grants the normal Armor Class for its type, plus the magical armor bonus, as rolled on the Magic Armor table; for example, Plate Mail +2 provides an Armor Class of 19.

There are two varieties of **cursed armor**: Cursed Armor -1 and Cursed Armor AC 11. The first variety's AC is reduced by the rolled penalty; for example, Plate Mail -1 grants Armor Class 16. The second type is much worse, for regardless of the type, it only provides Armor Class 11. Dexterity and shield bonuses still apply.

Cursed armor cannot be removed from the wearer once the curse is proven, that is, once the wearer is hit in combat. Once the curse has taken effect, only a **remove curse** spell, or some more powerful magic (such as a wish), will enable the wearer to remove it. The armor will detect as magical, like any other magic armor; the curse cannot be detected by any means other than wearing the armor in combat.

### Potions

A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker. Unless otherwise noted, a potion grants its benefits for 1d6+6 turns (even if the duration of an associated spell is longer or shorter).

**Clairaudience:** This potion enables the drinker to hear sounds in another area through the ears of a living creature in that area, up to a maximum 60' away. This effect otherwise functions just as the spell **clairvoyance**.

**Clairvoyance:** This potion grants the imbiber the effect of the **clairvoyance**spell.

**Cold Resistance:** This potion grants the imbiber the power of the spell **resist cold**.

**Control Animal:** This potion functions like a **control human** potion, but affects only normal, non-magical animals.

**Control Dragon:** This potion functions like a **control human** potion, but affects only dragons.

**Control Giant:** This potion functions like a **control human** potion, but affects only giants.

**Control Human:** This potion allows the drinker to charm a human, demi-human, or humanoid by gazing at them. The effect functions like the **charm person** spell. If the charm is resisted, the drinker can attempt to charm up to two more targets before the potion's benefit is exhausted.

**Control Plant:** This potion grants the drinker control over one or more plants or plant creatures within a 10' square area up to 50' away. Normal plants become animated, having a movement rate of 10', and obey the drinker's commands. If ordered to attack, only the largest plants can do any real harm, attacking with a +0 attack bonus and inflicting 1d4 points of damage per hit. Affected plant creatures (who fail to save vs. Spells) can understand the drinker, and behave as if under a **charm monster** spell.

**Control Undead:** This potion grants the drinker command of 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Mindless undead follow the drinker's commands exactly; free-willed undead act as if under a **charm person** spell.

**Delusion:** This cursed potion will appear, if tested or analyzed, to be one of the other potions (other than poison). When imbibed, the drinker will briefly believe he has received the benefits of the "other" potion, but the illusion will be swiftly exposed...

**Diminution:** This potion reduces the drinker and all items worn or carried to one-twelfth of his or her original height (so that a 6' tall character becomes 6" tall). The drinker's weight is divided by 1,728; this makes an armed warrior weigh less than 2.5 ounces. The affected creature cannot make an effective attack against any creature bigger than a house cat, but may be able to slip under doors or into cracks and has a 90% chance of moving about undetected (both in terms of sound and vision).

**ESP:** This potion grants the power of the spell of the same name.

**Fire Resistance:** This potion grants the imbiber the power of the spell **resist fire**.

**Flying:** This spell grants the power of the spell **fly**.

**Gaseous Form:** The drinker and all of his or her gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. He or she becomes immune to non-magical weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical weapons. The imbiber can't attack or cast spells while in gaseous form. The drinker also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10', and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, as long as the potion persists. The gaseous creature is subject to the effects of wind, and can't enter water or other liquid. Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those brought along when the potion was imbibed. The drinker cannot resume material form at will, but must wait for the potion to expire; however, the potion may be quaffed in thirds, in which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.

**Giant Strength:** This potion grants the imbiber the Strength of a giant. For the duration, the drinker gains a bonus of +5 on attack and damage rolls with melee or thrown weapons, and can throw large stones just as a stone giant can.

**Growth:** The drinker of this potion (with all equipment worn or carried) becomes twice normal height and eight times normal weight. The enlarged character is treated as having the Strength of a Stone Giant (but without the rock-throwing ability), gaining +5 on attack and damage rolls.

**Healing:** The imbiber of this potion receives 1d6+1 hit points of healing (as the spell **cure light wounds**).

**Heroism:** This potion improves the fighting ability of the drinker. Fighters of less than 3^rd^ level gain +3 to attack bonus as well as gaining 3 hit dice. Fighters of 4^th^ to 5^th^ level gain +2 to attack bonus and 2 hit dice. Fighters of 6^th^ or 7^th^ level gain +1 to attack bonus and 1 hit die. Fighters of 8^th^ level or higher, as well as non-Fighter class characters, gain no hit dice, but still receive +1 to attack bonus. Hit dice gained are only temporary, and damage received is deducted from those hit dice first; any that remain when the potion expires are simply lost.

**Invisibility:** This potion makes the imbiber invisible (as the spell). This potion may be quaffed in thirds, in which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.

**Invulnerability:** This potion grants a bonus of +2 to Armor Class.

**Levitation:** This potion grants the power of the spell **levitate**.

**Longevity:** The drinker of this potion becomes younger by 1d10 years.

**Poison:** This isn't a potion at all, it's a trap. The drinker must save vs. Poison or die, even if only a sip was imbibed.

**Polymorph Self:** This potion grants the power of the spell of the same name.

**Speed:** This potion gives the drinker the benefits of the spell **haste**.

**Treasure Finding:** The imbiber of this potion will immediately know the direction and approximate distance to the largest treasure hoard in a 300' spherical radius. This potion specifically detects platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and copper; gemstones and magic items are not detected.

### Scrolls

Most scrolls contain some sort of magic which is activated when read, and which may only be used once; the characters burn away as the words are read.

**Spell Scrolls** are enchanted with one or more Cleric or Magic-User spells (never both sorts on the same scroll). Each spell can be used just once, though of course the same spell may appear multiple times on a single scroll. Use the table below to determine the spell level of each spell on a scroll. Only a Cleric can use a Clerical scroll, and only a Magic-User can use a Magic-User scroll.

Magic-Users must cast **read magic** on a spell scroll before being able to use it; each scroll needs to be treated in this way just once, and the effect lasts indefinitely thereafter. If a Magic-User attempts to cast a spell from a scroll, and he or she does not know that spell, there is a 10% chance the spell will fail. If a spell on a scroll is of higher level than the highest level spell the Magic-User can cast, for each spell level of difference, add 10% to the chance of failure. For example, Aura the 3^rd^ level Magic-User attempts to cast **polymorph self** from a scroll. Aura is able to cast, at most, 2^nd^ level spells. **Polymorph self** is a 4^th^ level spell, so Aura has a chance of failure of 10% (she doesn't know the spell) plus 20% (2^nd^ level maximum vs. 4^th^ level spell), for a total of 30%.

Clerical scrolls are written in a normal language (being just specially enchanted prayers), so the Cleric merely needs to know the language in which the scroll is written in order to use it. Clerics suffer the same chance of failure as do Magic-Users, save that the 10% penalty assigned for not knowing the spell does not apply.

#### Spell Scrolls: Spell Level

| **d%** | **Level of Spell** |
| 01-30 | 1st |
| 31-55 | 2nd |
| 56-75 | 3rd |
| 76-88 | 4th |
| 89-97 | 5th |
| 98-00 | 6th |

A **Cursed Scroll** inflicts some curse upon whoever reads it. It need not be read completely; in fact, merely glancing at the text is enough to inflict the curse. A saving throw may or may not be allowed, as determined by the GM (though a save vs. Spells should usually be allowed). The GM is encouraged to be creative when creating curses; the spell **bestow curse** (the reverse of **remove curse**) can be used for inspiration, but cursed scrolls can contain more powerful or inventive curses at the GM's discretion.

**Protection Scrolls** can be read by any character class, assuming the character can read the language the scroll is written in (see the notes under **Language** in the **Character** section for details). When read, a protection scroll creates a 10' radius protective circle around the reader; preventing the warded creatures from entering. The circle moves with the reader. Any creature other than the sort the scroll wards may enter, including of course the allies of the scroll-reader, who are themselves protected so long as they remain entirely within the circle. If any creature within the circle performs a melee attack against any of the warded creatures, the circle is broken and the warded creatures may freely attack. Normal protection scrolls last for 2 turns after being read.

**Protection from Magic** scrolls are special, as they protect against magic spells and items rather than creatures. No magical effect can cross the 10' circle of protection in either direction for 1d4 turns. As with the other protection scrolls, the circle created by this scroll moves with the reader.

**Treasure Maps** are generally non-magical. They must be created by the GM, although he or she may delay creating the map until the characters can actually use it. The treasure indicated on the map will normally be guarded by some sort of monster, determined by the GM as desired.

### Rings

A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than one ring per hand) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).

**Control Animal:** The wearer of this ring can charm up to 6 hit dice of animals. The effect works much like a **charm person** spell, but only affects animals (including giant-sized animals, but excluding fantastic creatures as well as anything more intelligent than a dog or cat). The wearer can activate the power at will, targeting any animal within 60' that he or she can see. The wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to "free" enough hit dice to control a new target.

**Control Human:** The wearer of this ring may cast the spell **charm person** at any target he or she can see within 60'. The wearer can use this power once per round, at will, but cannot control more than 6 hit dice of creatures at a time; however, the wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to "free" enough hit dice to control a new target.

**Control Plant:** The wearer of this ring may create an effect equivalent to a **potion of plant control** at will, affecting plants or plant creatures within 60' that he or she can see. The effect lasts as long as the wearer remains within 60' of the plants or plant creatures. A saving throw is allowed just as for the potion.

**Delusion:** This ring appears to be some other sort of ring (roll again on the rings table to determine what sort). Whoever wears it believes it is working, and behaves thus (so a character who believes he is wearing a **ring of invisibility** will believe himself to actually be invisible). Unlike the potion of the same name, the ring's effect is not dispelled by the wearer taking damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this cursed item is with the spell **remove curse**.

**Djinni Summoning:** This ring serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed, the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes non-magical and worthless.

**Fire Resistance:** The wearer of this ring receives protection as the spell **resist fire**, but the protection works continually.

**Invisibility:** By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can benefit from **invisibility**, as the spell. If the invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the ring may not be reactivated for one full turn. The invisibility effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours.

**Protection:** This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a bonus to the Armor Class of the wearer (varying from +1 to +3 as shown on the table). This bonus is also applied to the wearer's saving throw die rolls.

**Regeneration:** This ring grants the wearer the power of regeneration, exactly as described in the description of the troll, including the weakness with respect to acid and fire damage. However, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.

**Spell Storing:** A ring of spell storing contains a number of Magic-User spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. Any class may wear and use this ring, but it can only be recharged by a Magic-User casting the appropriate spell into it. A table is provided below to determine how many spells, and what levels they are. A ring of spell storing must be recharged with the same spells that were placed into it when it was made; so a ring of two spell storing containing **fireball** and **fly** can only be recharged with those two spells. The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells stored within it. A ring found in a treasure hoard may be completely charged, or discharged, or partially charged, at the GM's option.

| 01-24 | 1   | 01-30 | 1st |
| 25-48 | 2   | 31-55 | 2nd |

**Spell Turning:** This ring reflects spells cast directly at the wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the caster; so a **hold person** spell would be reflected, but not a **fireball**. It will reflect up to 2d6 spells before its power is exhausted.

**Telekinesis:** The wearer of this ring can use the power of the spell **telekinesis**, as if cast by a 12^th^ level Magic-User. The effect may be used as many times per day as the wearer wishes, but lasts only as long as the wearer concentrates on it.

**Water Walking:** This ring allows the wearer to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the wearer's feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Molten lava will still cause the wearer damage from the heat since he or she is still near it. The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.

**Weakness:** Whoever puts this ring on is cursed; his or her Strength score is reduced immediately to 3. The ring can only be removed with **remove curse**.

**Wishes:** A ring of wishes contains the power to grant wishes to the wearer. 1d4 wishes will remain within the ring when it is found. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the **Game Master** section regarding this.

**X-Ray Vision:** On command, this ring gives its possessor the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead or gold blocks the vision. The ring may be used three times per day, and each use lasts at most one turn (or until the wearer ceases to concentrate upon it).

### Wands, Staves and Rods

A wand is a short stick, generally 12 to 18 inches long, imbued with the power to cast a specific spell or spell-like effect. A newly created wand has 20 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges; a wand found in a treasure hoard will have 2d10 charges remaining. If a wand generates an effect equivalent to a spell, assume the spell functions as if cast by a 6^th^ level caster, or the lowest level caster who could cast that spell (whichever is higher), unless otherwise noted. Wands are generally usable only by Magic-Users. Saving throws are rolled as normal, but on the Magic Wands column rather than the Spells column.

A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 30 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges. A staff found in a treasure hoard will have 3d10 charges remaining. Spell effects generated by a staff operate at 8^th^ level, or the lowest caster level the spell could be cast by, whichever is higher, unless otherwise stated. Staves are usable only by Magic-Users, except where noted. Saving throws against magic from a staff are rolled on the Spells column.

A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell. Rods are normally usable by any class.

**Rod of Cancellation:** This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. If the item is held by a creature, an attack roll is needed to touch it. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a **wish**.

**Snake Staff:** This item is a walking staff +1. When used by a Cleric, the user may command the staff to transform into a constrictor snake (instead of causing damage) on a successful hit. The snake will wrap around a target up to man sized and hold him or her fast for 1d4 turns, unless a save vs. Spells is made. The snake does not attack in any other way, nor cause any damage. The snake may be recalled by the user at any point, in which case it returns to his or her hand and returns to staff form. It also returns in this way when the duration expires, or if the save is made. The snake has Armor Class 15, moves 20' per round and has 20 hit points; any hit points of damage taken are healed completely when the snake returns to staff form; if killed in snake form, the magic is destroyed and it turns into a broken stick. The staff may be used any number of times per day, and neither has nor uses charges.

**Staff of Commanding:** This staff can cast **charm person** and **charm monster** spells, and can grant a power equivalent to a **potion of plant control**. Each function uses one charge.

**Staff of Healing:** This staff can heal 1d6+1 hit points per charge expended, as the spell **cure light wounds**. Alternately, with an expenditure of two charges, the staff can cast **cure disease**. This staff is only usable by a Cleric.

**Staff of Power:** This is a very potent magic item, with offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers costing one charge per use: **lightning bolt**(6d6 damage), **fireball** (6d6 damage), **cone of cold** (as the wand, for 6d6 damage), **continual light**, and **telekinesis** (as the ring, lasting at most 1d6 turns). The staff is also a +2 walking staff, and can be used exactly as a **staff of striking**. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30' radius, doing 1d6 damage per charge remaining (save vs. Spells for half damage). All within the area, including the wielder, are affected by this.

After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 walking staff. Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.

**Staff of Striking:** This staff has no attack bonus, but is treated as a +1 weapon with respect to what sorts of monsters it can hit (and is usable by any class in that mode). This staff's primary power may only be used if wielded by a Cleric: By uttering a command word, the Cleric may create an effect similar to the spell **striking**. Expenditure of one charge adds 1d6 damage to the weapon's next strike; expenditure of two charges adds 2d6, and expenditure of three charges adds 3d6 damage. If the weapon is not successfully used after the command word has been spoken, the effect dissipates after one turn.

**Staff of Wizardry:** This staff is equivalent to the** staff of power**, above, and has the following powers as well: **invisibility**, **passwall**, **web**, and **conjure elementals** (as the spell, but conjuring staff elementals as described in the **Monsters** section). These powers each use one charge when activated.

**Wand of Cold:** This wand generates a conical blast of cold doing 6d8 damage (save vs. Magic Wands for half damage). The cone spreads from the tip of the wand to a width of 30' at a distance of 40' away.

**Wand of Enemy Detection:** The effect of this wand is to make all enemies of the user within 60' glow with a greenish white light for one round. Even hidden or invisible enemies glow in this way, revealing them, but enemies completely out of sight (such as behind a wall) may not be seen by the user. An "enemy" is any creature which is thinking of or otherwise intending to harm the user; also, all undead monsters and animated constructs within range will glow in this way regardless of intent or thoughts (or lack thereof).

**Wand of Fear:** This wand generates the effect of the spell **cause fear** (the reverse of the spell **remove fear**).

**Wand of Fireballs:** This wand generates **fireball**s, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.

**Wand of Illusion:** This wand allows the user to create illusions equivalent to the spell **phantasmal force**.

**Wand of Lightning Bolts:** This wand generates **lightning bolts**, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.

**Wand of Magic Detection:** This wand grants the user a power equivalent to the spell **detect magic**.

**Wand of Paralyzation:** This wand creates the effect of the spell **hold person**.

**Wand of Polymorph:** This wand can be used to cast either **polymorph self** or **polymorph other**.

**Wand of Secret Door Detection:** This wand grants the user a power similar to the spell **find traps**, but which reveals secret doors rather than traps.

**Wand of Trap Detection:** This wand grants the user a power equivalent to the spell **find traps**.

### Miscellaneous Magic Items

**Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location:** The wearer of this item is immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal balls, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and any other means of location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of mind reading (such as the spell **ESP**). Other characters who remain within 30' of the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to mind reading.

**Bag of Devouring:** This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a **bag of holding**, and in fact it performs exactly like one when first used. However, all items placed within disappear forever 1d6+6 turns later. The bag continues to weigh whatever it did after the items were placed within it (that is, one-tenth the total weight of the items), until it is again opened and discovered to be empty.

**Bag of Holding:** This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into an extradimensional space, and is able to hold more than should be possible: up to 500 pounds of weight, and up to 70 cubic feet of volume. A bag of holding weighs one-tenth as much as the total of the objects held within. Any object to be stored in a bag of holding must fit through the opening, which has a circumference of 4 feet.

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to one turn, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding takes a full round during which no movement may be made.

**Boots of Levitation:** On command, these leather boots allow the wearer to **levitate** as if by the spell of the same name.

**Boots of Speed:** The wearer of these boots can click his or her boot heels together, thus activating a **haste**spell effect for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the **haste**effect need not be consecutive rounds; the boots can be turned off and on as desired.

**Boots of Traveling and Leaping:** These boots increase the wearer's base land speed by an additional 10' per round. In addition to this traveling ability, these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps, jumping up to 10' high and/or 30' across.

**Bowl Commanding Water Elementals:** This large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a water elemental appears and follows the commands of the summoner (as described for the Elemental monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.

**Brazier Commanding Fire Elementals:** This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a fire elemental appears and follows the commands of the summoner (as described for the Elemental monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.

**Broom of Flying:** This broom is able to fly through the air for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as he or she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when the command word is spoken.

**Censer Commanding Air Elementals:** This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth an air elemental which follows the commands of the summoner (as described for the Elemental monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.

**Cloak of Displacement:** This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and warp light waves, causing the wearer's apparent location to shift around constantly over a range of 3' from his or her true location. The first melee or missile attack by any creature against the wearer will miss, and all further attacks by that attacker are made with an attack penalty of -2. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.

**Crystal Ball:** This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. They may only be used by Magic-Users, who can use the device to see over virtually any distance. A crystal ball can be used three times per day, for up to a turn each time.

The chance of success when using a crystal ball is as shown below. Total chances equal to or greater than 100% do not require a roll.

| **Knowledge and Connection** | **Chance** |
|----|-----|
| Secondhand Knowledge (heard of) | 25% |
| Firsthand Knowledge (seen briefly) | 55% |
| Familiar (known well) | 95% |
| Possession or garment | +25% |
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. | +50% |

The user of the crystal ball is the only one who will see the image. No sound will be heard normally. **Detect magic**, **detect evil**, and **ESP** have a 3% chance per level of the caster of operating correctly if used with a crystal ball.

**Crystal Ball with Clairaudience:** This item works exactly like the standard crystal ball, above, but also allows the user to hear any sounds in the location viewed as if he or she were there.

**Drums of Panic:** These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures of less than 6 hit dice within 120' (with the exception of those within a 20' radius safe zone around the drums) must save vs. Spells or flee in fear. The drums can be used once per day.

**Efreeti Bottle:** This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals; or, it may be a lamp made of brass. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01--10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91--100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11--90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to an hour per day for 101 days (or until the efreeti's death), doing as he or she commands. After 101 days have passed, the efreeti is freed from service and may return to its extradimensional home. Roll only the first time the bottle is opened (or the GM may choose which sort of bottle is found as he or she desires).

**Elven Boots:** These soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a 90% chance of success when moving silently (as the Thief ability of the same name).

**Elven Cloak:** This cloak of neutral gray cloth is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color. However, when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, the wearer becomes nearly invisible, granting an 80% chance that the wearer can move about unnoticed. If detected by onlookers, the wearer can be attacked without significant penalty.

**Flying Carpet:** This rug is able to fly through the air on command. A flying carpet is typically 5' x 8' in size and can carry up to 500 pounds at a movement rate of 100' per round, or up to 1000 pounds (its maximum capacity) at a rate of 50' per round. A flying carpet can fly at any speed up to its maximum, and can hover on command.

**Gauntlets of Ogre Power:** These gauntlets are made of tough leather with iron studs running across the back of the hands and fingers. They grant the wearer a Strength bonus of +4 (instead of his or her own Strength bonus). Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.

**Girdle of Giant Strength:** This item grants the wearer the Strength of a giant. For so long as it is worn, the wearer gains a Strength bonus of +5 (instead of his or her own Strength bonus), and can throw large stones just as a stone giant does.

**Helm of Reading Languages and Magic:** Appearing as a normal helmet, this helm grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing. Note that the limitations described under the spell **read languages** apply to this device also. Understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use.

**Helm of Telepathy:** The wearer can read the surface thoughts of a target creature within 90' as if using the spell **ESP**. Furthermore, he or she can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts are thus being read (allowing two-way communication). This helm may be used up to three times per day.

**Helm of Teleportation:** A character wearing this device may **teleport**three times per day, exactly as if he or she had cast the spell of the same name.

**Horn of Blasting:** This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 2d6 points of damage to creatures within a cone 40' long and 40' wide at the far end, and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds. Affected creatures may save vs. Death Ray, taking half damage and avoiding deafness if the save is made. Crystalline creatures take double damage. Nonliving creatures are generally immune to deafness, but still suffer damage as described.

If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 10% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 3d6 points of damage to the person sounding it.

The horn can also be used to damage or destroy buildings, fortifications, etc. Double the damage listed above when a **horn of blasting** is used against a structure. The **Stronghold** rules in the **Game Master** section contains further guidance on this.

**Horn of Doom:** When blown, this horn will create animated skeletons or zombies as if by the spell **animate dead.** Up to 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters will be so created from remains within a 60' radius of the character who blew the horn. If both skeletal and fleshy remains are available in the area of effect, skeletons will be animated in preference over zombies. If the user is a magic-user or cleric, the created undead may be controlled so long as that character retains the horn. If blown by a fighter or thief, the undead created will be uncontrolled. Uncontrolled undead monsters will attack any living creatures nearby. The horn may be used once per day, but no more than 18 hit dice of undead created by the horn may exist at any one time.

**Medallion of ESP:** This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or nickel-silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, as with the spell **ESP**. It can be used as many times per day as desired, but each such usage requires a minimum of 1 round of full concentration to activate, and the wearer must continue to concentrate to maintain the effect.

**Mirror of Life Trapping:** This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. Only a Magic-User can properly control this device. The same command word deactivates the mirror. The character who activates the device is immune to it. The mirror has twenty extradimensional cells within it; any creature coming within 30' of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a save vs. Spells or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells.

When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) is taken also. The mirror's owner can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage the powerless prisoner in conversation. He or she can also free any trapped creature by verbal command.

If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

**Rope of Climbing:** This 50' long rope is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10' per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner. The rope must have something to tie itself to in order to support weight other than its own. One end of the rope must be held by the user when its magic is invoked.

**Scarab of Protection:** This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. The scarab absorbs energy-draining attacks, death effects, and curses*.* Upon absorbing 2d6 such attacks, the scarab crumbles to dust and is destroyed.

**Stone Commanding Earth Elementals:** A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped piece of roughly polished rock. The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner and follows the commands of the summoner (as described for the Elemental monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.
