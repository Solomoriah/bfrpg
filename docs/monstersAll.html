<p>Giant ants are among the hardiest and most adaptable vermin. Soldiers and workers are about 5 to 6 feet long, while queens can grow to a length of 9 feet. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.</p>
<p>Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.</p>

<p>The statistics above represent common sorts of wild herd animals, including deer (1 hit die), aurochs (2 hit dice), elk or moose (3 hit dice) and bison (4 hit dice). Such creatures are often skittish and likely to flee if provoked, but males are more aggressive in the presence of females (the parenthesized morale applies in this case).</p>

<p>The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant found in temperate forests that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.</p>
<p>Because it can lie very still indeed, an assassin vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.</p>
<p>An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.</p>
<p>A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.</p>
<p>A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.</p>

<p>A basilisk is an eight-legged reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature weighs about 300 pounds.</p>
<p>Any living creature which meets the gaze of the basilisk must save vs.&nbsp;Petrification or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs.&nbsp;Petrification or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.</p>

<p>Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.</p>
<p>A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area, flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the bats remain in the area.</p>
<p>A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200 pounds. They have the same sensory abilities as normal-sized bats, but being much larger, they are able to attack adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such attacks likely.</p>

<p>Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long. In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10’ long and 10’ wide at the far end (a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray for half damage is allowed). A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times per day, but no more often than once per three rounds. Faced with opponents attacking from just one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.</p>
<p>Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.</p>

<p>Black puddings are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch and digest their prey.</p>
<p>If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be split into two puddings; the GM should divide the original black pudding’s hit dice between the two however he or she sees fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.</p>
<p>Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack forms will affect a black pudding normally; the preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.</p>
<p>The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the splitting described above.</p>

<p>The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited teleportation ability; they are able to teleport up to 120’ at will. Blink dogs may teleport immediately after attacking, thus possibly avoiding being attacked. In particular, a blink dog may teleport next to an opponent, attack, and teleport away in the same round; the victim would need to strike on the same Initiative number as the blink dog in order to attack it in melee.</p>
<p>Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to get the bonus for attacking from behind.</p>
<p>Blink dogs are medium-sized dogs, typically light brown in color and short haired, though other varieties are rumored to exist. They have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines, and growls that can transmit complex information. They are usually shy, avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate&nbsp;<strong>displacers</strong>&nbsp;and will generally attack them on sight.</p>

<p>Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.</p>
<p>The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30’ from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or become befuddled, dropping anything carried and approaching the plant. Each round such a creature or character is within the affected area, this save must be made. Befuddled characters will not resist the plant-creature’s attacks; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.</p>
<p>Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) “eaten” this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.</p>

<p>Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about 6 feet tall. Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they move very quietly. They are wild and relatively fearless, and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.</p>
<p>Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents if they can. When hunting, they often send scouts ahead of the main group. Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant. They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30’ range.</p>
<p>One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.</p>

<p>Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety grows up to 30’ long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.</p>
<p>A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.</p>
<p>Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal.</p>

<p>Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive “hairs” on their legs to sense the environment around them.</p>
<p>These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.</p>
<p>All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster’s shrieking.</p>
<p>A giant cave locust can leap up to 60’ horizontally, or up to 30’ up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.</p>
<p>Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10’ away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.</p>

<p>A triceratops is a three-horned herbivorous dinosaur. They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking anyone who might appear to be a threat. These creatures are about 25 feet long and weigh about 20,000 pounds. A triceratops will usually attempt to trample smaller opponents. Up to two adjacent man-sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man sized. Also note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore attack.</p>

<p>The tyrannosaurus rex is a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur. Despite its enormous size and 6-ton weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. Its head is nearly 6 feet long, and its teeth are from 3 to 6 inches in length. It is slightly more than 30 feet long from nose to tail. A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about anything it sees. Its tactics are simple – charge in and bite.</p>
<p>The statistics above can also be used to represent other large bipedal carnosaurs, such as the allosaurus.</p>

<p>Displacers are blue-black, catlike monsters with strange bladed winglike arms extending from their shoulders. The blades are carried folded back like wings, but the Displacer swings the blades around in front to attack.</p>
<p>The real power and danger of the Displacer is its power of&nbsp;<strong>displacement</strong>, which causes the monster’s apparent location to shift around constantly over a range of 3’ from the monster’s true location. This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.</p>
<p>Any character fighting a Displacer for the first time will miss his or her first strike regardless of the die roll. Thereafter, all attacks against displacers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind. Some monsters, such as bats, do not depend on vision to fight and thus may be able to perceive the monster’s true location and fight without penalty.</p>

<p>The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about 10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind (see below) to harass those who follow; the 12 morale reflects a djinni’s absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the “8” figure to determine whether an outmatched djinn decides to leave a combat.</p>
<p>Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures):&nbsp;<strong>create food and drink</strong>, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6 humans or similar creatures, once per day; become&nbsp;<strong>invisible</strong>, with unlimited uses per day;&nbsp;<strong>create normal items</strong>, creating up to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day; assume&nbsp;<strong>gaseous form</strong>, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and&nbsp;<strong>create illusions</strong>, as the spell&nbsp;<strong>phantasmal force</strong>&nbsp;but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.</p>
<p>Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.</p>
<p>Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical attacks based on either cold or wind.</p>

<p>Normal dogs include most medium and large breeds, including wild dogs. After biting an opponent, a dog can hold on, doing 1d4 damage automatically every round, until killed or until the victim spends an attack breaking free (which requires a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray, adjusted by the character’s Strength bonus).</p>
<p>Riding dogs are a large breed, used primarily by Halflings for transport. They may be trained for war, and equipped with barding to improve their Armor Class. They can maintain a hold in the same way that normal dogs do. A light load for a riding dog is up to 150 pounds; a heavy load, up to 300 pounds.</p>

<p>Dopplegangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter; they can also read minds (as the spell,&nbsp;<strong>ESP</strong>, but with no limit of duration). In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppleganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance. In its natural form a doppleganger is about 5½ feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.</p>
<p>Dopplegangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived.</p>
<p>When in its natural form, a doppleganger strikes with its powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its mind reading power to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating.</p>

<section id="dragon" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dragon">Dragon</h2>
<p>Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>
<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>
<p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>
<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.</p>
<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.</p>
<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon’s breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM’s option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.</p>
<p>The shapes are:</p>
<p><strong>Cone Shaped:</strong>&nbsp;The breath weapon begins at the dragon’s mouth, and is about 2’ wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon’s type and age).</p>
<p><strong>Line Shaped:</strong>&nbsp;The breath weapon is 5’ wide and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Shaped:</strong>&nbsp;The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20’ deep or high.</p>
<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;” this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>
<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.</p>
<p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).</p>

<p>Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.</p>
<p>Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100’ (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>
<p>Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.</p>

<p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>
<p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>
<p>Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.</p>

<p>Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known quickly – it enjoys evoking terror.</p>
<p>Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be allowed to live so long as they remain interesting… but woe to them when the dragon becomes bored.</p>
<p>Green dragons are immune to all poisons. Note that, despite their breath weapon being described as “poison gas,” damage done by it is exactly the same as with other dragons. More specifically, those in the area of effect do not have to “save or die” as with ordinary poison, but rather save vs.&nbsp;Breath Weapon for half damage.</p>

<p>Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they might be carrying.</p>
<p>Red dragons are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt, torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a red dragon will attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.</p>
<p>Red dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire.</p>

<p>Though they live in the water and are somewhat adapted to it, Sea Dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or whales. A Sea Dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while swimming or performing other moderate activity.</p>
<p>These dragons have much the same physical structure as other dragons, but their feet are webbed and their tails are short, flat and broad; these adaptations help the sea dragon swim efficiently, but severely limit their ability to walk on dry land. Unlike other dragons, sea dragons do not have a tail attack. The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.</p>
<p>Young sea dragons are light bluish-gray in color (similar to dolphins), darkening to a deep slate color in older individuals.</p>
<p>Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same way as white dragons. They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea caverns.</p>

<p>White Dragons prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for pleasure.</p>
<p>White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. Typically, a white dragon begins with its icy breath weapon, then tries to eliminate a single opponent with a follow-up attack.</p>
<p>White dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half damage from magical cold or ice.</p>

<p>A dragon turtle’s rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle can measure from 100 to 200 feet from snout to tail. They are occasionally mistaken for rocky outcroppings or even small islands.</p>
<p>Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and generally attack any creature that threatens their territory or looks like a potential meal. Though they are not true dragons, they do advance through the same sort of age categories as the true dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon turtle’s Hit Dice by 5.</p>
<p>style=“position: absolute; top: 0in; left: 0in” Due to their massive size, dragon turtles are immune to virtually all poisons.</p>

<p>Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.</p>
<p>A dryad’s delicate features are much like a female elf’s, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.</p>
<p>Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring – they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad can charm (as the spell&nbsp;<strong>charm person</strong>), attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.</p>

<p>A typical giant eagle stands about 10 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way except size. It weighs about 500 pounds. Many giant eagles are intelligent creatures and speak Common.</p>
<p>A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its powerful talons and slashing beak to strike at its target’s head and eyes.</p>
<p>A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not appear threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making repeated diving attacks to drive away intruders, and fights to the death to defend their nest or hatchlings.</p>

<p>The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do this for enjoyment as much as for tactical reasons.</p>
<p>Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti’s absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the “9” figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.</p>
<p>Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become&nbsp;<strong>invisible</strong>, with unlimited uses per day; assume&nbsp;<strong>gaseous form</strong>, as the potion, up to one hour per day;&nbsp;<strong>create illusions</strong>, as the spell&nbsp;<strong>phantasmal force</strong>&nbsp;but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day;&nbsp;<strong>create flame</strong>, with unlimited uses; and create a&nbsp;<strong>wall of fire</strong>&nbsp;(as the spell), once per day. Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60’, causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.</p>
<p>Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.</p>
<p>Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks.</p>

<p>Air elementals resemble “dust devils,” that is, small whirlwinds, but they are much more powerful. Air elementals take double damage when attacked by earth-based attacks (including by earth elementals). An air elemental may choose either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one attack per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock all opponents in a 5’ radius to the ground; if the latter attack is used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or hit dice are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures or vehicles which are airborne.</p>

They cannot cross a body of water wider than their own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures which are cold or icy in nature.</p>
<p>Remember that a fire elemental is constantly burning; such a creature may easily start fires if it moves into an area containing items which burn easily, such as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific rules are given for such fires, but the GM is directed to the rules for burning oil for an example of fire damage.</p>

<p>Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge barracudas are about 12’ long, while giant specimens can exceed 20’. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.</p>
<p>Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven’t killed their prey. Both kinds are attracted to shiny objects.</p>

<p>Giant bass are generally between 10’ and 25’ long. Most are greenish-grey, marked with dark lateral stripes, though some are almost completely black. They are generally found in lakes or rivers, as they are not adapted for salt water.</p>
<p>Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).</p>

<p>Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs.&nbsp;Poison is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws; further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the duration of the poison effect.</p>
<p>Because of its large size (15 to 20 feet long) and body design, a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its attacks on any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and fin the same opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.</p>

<p>Giant frogs are enlarged versions of the common frog; most resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an adult giant frog is 3’ long and weighs about 250 pounds. They are predators, but will normally only attack creatures smaller than themselves. Giant toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however, they are often found in “drier” areas as they do not have to maintain a wet skin surface.</p>
<p>A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15’ and drag up to dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim.</p>

<p>Gargoyles are demonic-looking winged humanoid monsters with gray stone-like skin. They are often mistaken for winged stone statues, for they can remain still indefinitely without moving. Gargoyles use this disguise to ambush their foes, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 if their foes do not otherwise suspect them. They are cruel monsters, inflicting pain on other creatures for the sole purpose of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Gargoyles require no food, water, or air. Due to their highly magical nature, they can only be harmed by magical weapons.</p>

<p>The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cube’s body. A typical gelatinous cube is ten feet on a side and weighs about 15,000 pounds; however, smaller specimens have been reported.</p>
<p>A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes. Any character hit by a gelatinous cube must save vs.&nbsp;Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns.</p>

<p>Although these creatures look just like their lesser kin, the ghoul, they are far more deadly and cunning. Those hit by a ghast’s bite or claw attack must save vs.&nbsp;Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghasts try to attack with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind tombstones and bursting from shallow graves; when these methods are employed, they are able to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. They are undead, and thus are immune to sleep, charm and hold magics. They may be Turned by Clerics using the same column as the ghoul. As they are superior to ghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.</p>
<p>Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.</p>
<p>An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghast in this way retains none of the knowledge or abilities he or she possessed in life. The newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects.</p>
<p>The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a save vs.&nbsp;Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A&nbsp;<strong>neutralize poison</strong>&nbsp;spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.</p>

<p>Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit only by magical weapons.</p>
<p>Seeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs.&nbsp;Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs.&nbsp;a given ghost’s&nbsp;<strong>fear</strong>&nbsp;attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be affected by another.</p>
<p>A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score he or she sees fit.</p>
<p>Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of&nbsp;<strong>restoration</strong>; nothing else (except a&nbsp;<strong>wish</strong>) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character’s Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot be&nbsp;<strong>raised</strong>&nbsp;(but still may be&nbsp;<strong>reincarnated</strong>).</p>
<p>Once per turn, a ghost can use&nbsp;<strong>telekinesis</strong>&nbsp;(as the spell) as if it were a 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level Magic-User.</p>
<p>Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a&nbsp;<strong>magic jar</strong>&nbsp;spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs.&nbsp;Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target’s body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim’s body, or until it is driven out by means of a&nbsp;<strong>remove curse</strong>&nbsp;spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities.</p>

<p>Cloud giants’ skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. They have hair of silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.</p>
<p>Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.</p>
<p>Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. Cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200’ for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail.</p>

<p>Gnolls are nocturnal, and have Darkvision with a 30’ range. They are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader.</p>
<p>One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. Gnolls gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by such a warrior. In lairs of 12 or greater, there will be a pack leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, gnolls never fail a morale check as long as the pack leader is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present, and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hardened warrior statistically, and in addition has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular gnoll, and has Magic-User abilities of level 1d4.</p>

<p>Gnomes stand 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards.</p>
<p>Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30’ range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.</p>
<p>Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.</p>
<p>Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically.</p>

<p>Goblins are small, wicked humanoids that favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can devise. An adult goblin stands 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking, varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab, soiled-looking colors. They have Darkvision with a 30’ range.</p>
<p>The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30’ and a natural Armor Class of 11.</p>
<p>Some goblins ride&nbsp;<strong>dire wolves</strong>&nbsp;into combat, and large groups of goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.</p>
<p>One out of every eight goblins will be a warrior of 3-3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Goblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In a lair or other settlement, one out of every fifteen will be a chieftain of 5-5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and movement of 10’ that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs or settlements of 30 or more goblins, there will be a goblin king of 7-7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), wearing chainmail and carrying a shield, with a movement of 10’, and having a +1 bonus to damage. Goblins have a +2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is not cumulative with the bonus given by a warrior leader). In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="golem">Golem*</h2>
<p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental forces. The animating force for a golem is an elemental spirit. The process of creating the golem binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.</p>
<p>Being mindless, golems generally do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. A golem’s creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not actively commanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem’s creator can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else’s control, and so on), but the golem’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.</p>
<p>Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical weapons.</p>

<p>Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the skeletons of at least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone, they are not undead and cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a damage figure of 1d10/1d10 or by weapon.</p>
<p>When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time is required for each check. It takes 1 round of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%.</p>

<p>These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike natural bronze statues, they never turn green from verdigris. A bronze golem is 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. A bronze golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.</p>
<p>The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal. Creatures hit by one in combat suffer an additional 1d10 damage from the heat (unless resistant to heat or fire). If one is hit in combat, molten metal spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage. A save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.</p>

Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait.

<p>Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a 10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of effect must save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the&nbsp;<strong>slow</strong>&nbsp;spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.

<p>Gray oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. A gray ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.</p>
<p>A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material and metal, but not stone. After a successful hit, the ooze will stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8 damage per round automatically. Normal (non-magical) armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately. A non-magical metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze also dissolves immediately. Magical weapons, armor, and clothing are allowed a saving throw (use the wearer’s save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray, adding any magical “plus” value to the roll if applicable).</p>

<p>Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal given enough time. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below. Green slime cannot grow in sunlight; even the indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill green slime outright within a turn.</p>
<p>On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing the same damage to both the victim and the slime). A&nbsp;<strong>cure disease</strong>&nbsp;spell will destroy a patch of green slime. It does not harm stone or enchanted metal, but can dissolve normal metal or enchanted wood in a turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p>If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds, the victim will be completely transformed into green slime; such a character or creature cannot be retrieved by any magic short of a&nbsp;<strong>wish</strong>.</p>

<p>Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling lions with the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature’s back and span 25 feet or more. An adult griffon weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to feed on horses, the beast’s preferred prey. They hunt and travel in ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else, diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above retreating and coming back later, when there may be less of a defense mounted.</p>
<p>Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come within about 120’. Roll a morale check in this case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.</p>

<p>A harpy looks like a giant vulture bearing the torso and face of a human female. They are able to attack with their claws as well as with normal weapons, but their most insidious ability is their song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300’ radius must succeed on a save vs.&nbsp;Spells or become&nbsp;<strong>charmed</strong>. The same harpy’s song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves again for 24 hours. A charmed victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through ame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature is allowed a second saving throw to resist the charm. Charmed creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within reach of the harpy offers no resistance to the monster’s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings, and for one round thereafter.</p>

<p>style=“position: absolute; top: 0in; left: 0in” Hellhounds are canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame. A typical hell hound stands 4½ feet high at the shoulder and weighs 120 pounds. They are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs. In addition to biting, each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite. Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used.</p>
<p>A hellhound’s breath weapon is a cone of flame 10’ wide at the far end which is 10’ long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20’ long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30’ long for the largest hellhounds. This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.</p>
<p>Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3. A hellhound has an Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.</p>

<p>Hippogriffs resemble large ying horses with the forefront of a bird of prey. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes.&nbsp;<strong>Griffons</strong>&nbsp;sometimes prey upon them, and hippogriffs will generally attack griffons on sight if they have a numerical advantage.</p>
<p>Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense, save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load for a hippogriff is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.</p>

<p>Hobgoblins are larger cousins of goblins, being about the same size as humans. Their hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair. They wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30’ range.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents.</p>
<p>One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20’, having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), adding a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) (movement is still 20’) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.</p>

<p>Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. They are gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. Hydras are about 20 feet long and weigh about 4,000 pounds. They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.</p>
<p>A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster’s total hit points, of course.</p>
<p>Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10’ wide and 20’ long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.</p>

A hungry hyena will chew on anything that is even remotely tainted by blood, meat or other food traces. They will mostly be found in the same savanna-like environments where lions and zebras may be found. They can live in clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller groups are more common. They are among the favorite pets of gnolls, who may take them into regions where they are not normally found.</p>

Many varieties of hyenodons were smallish, sometimes no bigger than a common hyena, and the statistics for standard hyenas may be used for them. The above statistics are for the larger types of Hyenodons or giant varieties of Hyena.

<p>An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit. In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10’ cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10’ squares and the flying movement above is ignored.</p>
<p>Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is considered unarmored).</p>
<p>Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to “ward off” the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case also damage is reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>&nbsp;spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.</p>

<p>A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.</p>
<p>Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A&nbsp;<strong>detect invisible</strong>&nbsp;spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud. Don’t forget to apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to see it.</p>

<p>Kobolds are small, dog-faced reptilian humanoids. A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60’, and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of&nbsp;<strong>light</strong>&nbsp;spells. Kobolds typically wear leather armor in battle.</p>
<p>One out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 10’, and who has a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.</p>
<p>Kobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies, and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However, they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat, leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how to avoid.</p>

<p>A lizard man is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3 to 4 feet long. Adult males can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds. Due to their great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor and carry shields in battle.</p>
<p>Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile).

In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.</p>
<p>Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids, contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A&nbsp;<strong>cure disease</strong>&nbsp;cast before the onset is complete will stop the progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the transformation is permanent.</p>
<p>In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or magical weapons.</p>

<p>Manticores look like an overgrown lion with thick leathery wings and an ugly humanoid face, often like that of a human or bearded dwarf. Their tail ends in an assortment of spikes, which the beast may fire as projectiles; a maximum of 24 are available, and the manticore regrows 1d6 per day. A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Manticores are vicious predators, having a preference for human flesh. They will use their ranged attacks to “soften up” potential prey before closing to melee.</p>

<p>A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs.&nbsp;Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa’s reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs.&nbsp;Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.</p>
<p>Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).</p>
<p>A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.</p>
<p>Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.</p>

<p>Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of dolphins. Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.</p>
<p>A mermaid’s song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid’s temperament.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.</p>
<p>Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.</p>
<p>One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.</p>
<p>A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.</p>
<p>style=“position: absolute; top: 0in; left: 0in” Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.</p>

<p>Nixies are small water fairies. As far as anyone knows, all nixies are female. Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. They often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to&nbsp;<strong>charm person</strong>). The charm lasts one year (unless dispelled). A save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie can cast&nbsp;<strong>water breathing</strong>once per day, with a duration of one day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see&nbsp;<strong>Fish, Giant Bass</strong>&nbsp;for details).</p>
<p>Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened.</p>

<p>Ogres appear as large, very ugly humans. Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor. Ogres are brutish and aggressive, but inherently lazy. They employ direct attacks in combat, typically using large clubs, axes, or pole arms, generally causing 2d6 damage. If normal weapons are employed, an ogre has a +3 bonus to damage due to strength. If an ogre fights bare-handed, it does 1d8 subduing damage per hit.</p>
<p>One out of every six ogres will be a pack leader of 6+1 Hit Dice (500 XP). Ogres gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a pack leader.

<p>Orcs are grotesque humanoids bent on war and domination. They have lupine ears, reddish eyes, truncated, upturned noses, and black hair (but very little body hair). An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds; females are slightly smaller. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. They utilize all manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.</p>
<p>Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60’. They suffer a -1 attack penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a spell causing magical light. They speak their own rough and simple language, but many also speak some common or goblin.</p>
<p>One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP). Orcs gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In orc lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11), a movement 20’, and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be an orc king of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), in chainmail with a shield, movement 20’, and having a +2 bonus to damage.

<p>Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely found above ground. The body of a mature purple worm is 5-8 feet in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured by it must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. Note that the purple worm’s movement is less than the monster’s length, so that, if attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the stinger for several rounds.</p>
<p>Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been swallowed, and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due to being digested. A character who has been swallowed can only effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such as dagger or shortsword.</p>

<p>These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm reduces their numbers by one animal.</p>
<p>Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.</p>
<p>Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each point, the character is allowed a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray (adjusted by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero Constitution is dead. See&nbsp;<strong>Constitution Point Losses</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Encounter</strong>&nbsp;section for details on regaining lost Constitution.</p>
<p>* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or killing an entire pack of normal size. If the adventurers are forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.</p>

<p>The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and scorpions, though it is not properly either. Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an elongated extra pair of legs in front that have sticky pads on them for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.</p>
<p>A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast, and will be drawn to the rhagodessa’s mouth the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 damage. The rhagodessa will not use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.</p>

<p>The rhinoceros is infamous for its bad temper and willingness to charge intruders.</p>
<p>The statistics presented here are based on the African black rhino, which is 6 to 14 feet long, 3 to 6 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs up to 6,000 pounds. These statistics can describe any herbivore of similar size and similar natural weapons (antlers, horns, tusks, or the like).</p>

<p>Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a “normal” roc is huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet. Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).</p>
<p>A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.</p>
<p>A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary). A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any man-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.</p>

<p>Rot grubs are 1-inch long vermin found in carrion, dung, and other such garbage and organic material. Their skin color is white or brown. When a living creature contacts an area (dung heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will attack if they can come in contact the victim’s skin. A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim succeeds at a Wisdom check. If successful, the victim sees strange rippling beneath his skin. If failed, the creature does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 2d6 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs. After the second round, only a cure disease can kill the grubs as they burrow to the victim’s heart and devour it in 1d3 turns.</p>

<p>The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster’s prehensile antennae can rust metals on contact. The typical rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing 200 pounds.</p>
<p>A rust monster’s touch transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the rust monster; this loss is permanent.</p>
<p>The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this.</p>

<p>Salamanders are large, lizard-like creatures from the elemental planes. They are sometimes found on the material plane; they can arrive through naturally-occurring dimensional rifts, or they may be summoned by high-level Magic-Users. Due to their highly magical nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Flame salamanders</strong>&nbsp;come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They look like giant snakes, more than 12’ long, with dragonlike heads and lizard forelimbs. Their scales are all the colors of flame, red and orange and yellow. A flame salamander is flaming hot, and all non-fire-resistant creatures within 20’ of the monster suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the heat. They are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack. Flame salamanders are intelligent; they speak the language of the Plane of Fire, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>Frost salamanders</strong>&nbsp;come from the Elemental Plane of Water. They look like giant lizards with six legs. Their scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale blue. Frost salamanders are very cold, and all non-cold-resistant creatures within 20’ suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the cold. Frost salamanders are completely immune to all types of cold-based attacks. They are quite intelligent; all speak the language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak Common, Elvish, and/or Dragon.</p>
<p>Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each type will attack the other on sight, in preference over any other foe. If summoned by a Magic-User, a salamander is often assigned to protect a location, doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case, the salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the protected area. Those which arrive through natural rifts may have any goals or motivations the GM wishes, and thus may choose to parley, fight, or even ignore adventurers.</p>

<p>A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places. They lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by. A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak intelligibly. Despite their strange nature and appearance, shadows are not&nbsp;<strong>undead</strong>monsters, and thus cannot be Turned by a Cleric.</p>
<p>A shadow’s attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.</p>

<p>Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being up to 6’ long, and darker in color. They have a very fast metabolic rate and must eat almost constantly. Giant shrews are omnivorous, and aggressively defend their nests and the immediate territory around them.</p>
<p>Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite twice per round, and they may attack two different adjacent opponents in this way.</p>
<p>A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5% of those encountered) are venomous. The bite of such a giant shrew will kill the victim unless a save vs.&nbsp;Poison is made. A victim bitten twice in a round need only save once for that round, but of course will have to save again in subsequent rounds if bitten again. Venomous giant shrews are considered 1* with respect to hit dice.</p>

<p>A shrieker is a large (3’ to 5’ tall and about the same size across), semi-mobile fungus that emits a loud noise as a defense mechanism when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean places. They come in several shades of purple.</p>
<p>A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures monsters to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise. Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers learn that the fungus’ noise means there is food nearby. In game terms, the GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that a shrieker shrieks.</p>

<p>Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties ranging in size from 2’ to 12’ at adulthood; the statistics above are for an “average” variety which reaches about 9’ in length.</p>
<p>Those bitten by a pit viper must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die.</p>
<p>Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive “pits” between their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds, mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can still sense them because their temperature will often be slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.</p>
<p>Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the details given above, a rattlesnake has a rattle (from which it gets its name) at the end of its tail. The rattle is used to warn away larger creatures.</p>

<p>Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties rarely exceed 6’ in length. They have relatively small heads, and are very stealthy in the water. Their bite does so little damage that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any creature bitten must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.</p>
<p>Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested (grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so. They are very clumsy when out of the water.</p>

They use their spreading hood to warn other creatures not to bother them, and generally refrain from attacking if possible to allow larger creatures time to retreat.

<p>If a stirge hits a creature, it attaches and drains blood equal to 1d4 damage per round (on its Initiative). The creature can only be removed by killing it; any attack on the creature receives an attack bonus of +2, but any attack that misses hits the victim instead.</p>

<p>Tentacle worms appear to be giant worms of some sort, averaging 6 to 8 feet long. Their heads are pasty white or grey, but their bodies vary from livid pink or purple to deep green in color. Their tentacles splay out from around the creature’s “neck.” Some sages believe they are the larval form of some other monster, but this has never been proven.</p>
<p>A tentacle worm can attack as many as three adjacent opponents. Those hit must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis or be paralyzed 2d4 turns. No matter how many of a tentacle worm’s attacks hit an opponent in a given round, only one saving throw is required in each such round.</p>
<p>If all opponents of a tentacle worm are rendered paralyzed, it will begin to feed upon the paralyzed victims, doing 1 point of damage every 1d8 rounds until the victim is dead; if other paralyzed victims are still alive, the worm is 50% likely to move on immediately to another still-living victim. Otherwise, it continues to eat the corpse of the slain victim for 1d4 turns.</p>

<p>A titanothere is a huge prehistoric animal that resembles the rhinoceros; adults average 10’ tall and 13’ long. They have large, forked horns rather than the pointed horns of rhinos. Like rhinos, they are herd animals, and males aggressively defend the herd; females only enter combat if the male(s) are defeated or the attackers are very numerous. If a single titanothere is encountered, it will be a rogue male; they are bad tempered and prone to attacking smaller creatures that enter their territory.</p>

<p>A treant is a large, roughly humanoid tree-man. Treants have leaves of deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree. A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p>
<p>Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Elvish. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues, at least enough to say “Get away from my trees!” Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements.</p>
<p>A treant can animate trees within 180’ at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes one round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10’ and fights as a treant in all respects. Such trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range.</p>

<p>Troglodytes are very intelligent lizardlike humanoid creatures. They have large red eyes and spiny “combs” on their legs, head, and arms. They normally stand 5 to 6 feet tall. They can change color at will, and 50% of the time a group can blend into the environment well enough to surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.</p>
<p>Troglodytes secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of the Troglodyte must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within range of the Troglodyte. Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled.</p>
<p>Troglodytes are very hostile, attacking equal or weaker non-troglodyte groups on sight. They prefer to attack with surprise, depending on their color-changing ability for this.</p>
<p>One out of every eight troglodytes will be a warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to Strength. Troglodytes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In lairs of 24 or more, there will be a troglodyte leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) with an Armor Class of 17 and having a +2 bonus to damage due to Strength. In the lair, troglodytes never fail a morale check as long as the leader is alive.</p>

<p>A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. A troll’s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray. They appear sexless if examined, and their method of reproduction is a mystery. Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.</p>
<p>Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with fire or acid. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in one turn; or, the creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.</p>
<p>Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws.</p>

<p>Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.</p>
<p>Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.</p>
<p>Three times per day a unicorn can cast&nbsp;<strong>cure light wounds</strong>&nbsp;by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360’ (as the spell&nbsp;<strong>dimension door</strong>), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.</p>
<p>An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.</p>
<p>Alicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a&nbsp;<strong>ring of invisibility</strong>.</p>

<p>These creatures appear to be normal&nbsp;<strong>hobgoblins</strong>, but urgoblins are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to regenerate much as do&nbsp;<strong>trolls</strong>&nbsp;(with the same limitations). All urgoblins are male; if an urgoblin mates with a female hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in four such offspring will share their father’s gifts. Like hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields into battle, blending in perfectly.</p>
<p>Some hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to their mates, so that only those who have the power of regeneration survive.</p>

<p>Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves. They often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they knew in life.</p>
<p>A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.</p>
<p>The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if needed) for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, he or she will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the permanent control of the vampire who created them.</p>
<p>If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.</p>
<p>Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>charm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.</p>
<p>Vampires command the lesser creatures of the night and once per day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.</p>
<p>A vampire can assume the form of a&nbsp;<strong>giant bat</strong>or a&nbsp;<strong>dire wolf</strong>&nbsp;at will, requiring one round to complete the transformation. The flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In animal form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It can’t use its other powers while in animal form, except that creatures summoned are still controlled, and charms already in effect continue in effect.</p>
<p>For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:</p>
<p><strong>Repelling a Vampire:</strong>&nbsp;Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don’t harm the vampire – they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter.</p>
<p>Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.</p>
<p><strong>Slaying a Vampire:</strong>&nbsp;Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it, as described above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only one round and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.</p>

<p>Giant water termites vary from 1’ to 5’ in length. They attack using a noxious spray with a range of 5’ which stuns the target for a full turn on a hit; a save vs.&nbsp;Poison is allowed to avoid the effect. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the remainder of the current round and all of the next one.</p>
<p>However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4 points of damage to a ship’s hull per round (no roll required) for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature’s hit dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat noisily.</p>
<p>These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.</p>

<p>Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, having long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than themselves.</p>
<p>Weasels of all sorts are cunning, crafty hunters, and surprise their prey on 1-3 on 1d6. Once a giant weasel bites a living creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of its victim and flee.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only distinction is that those which are tamed are always called ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.</p>

<p>Narwhals are aquatic mammals resembling large dolphins with a single (or rarely, double) tusk protruding straight forward from the mouth. The tusk is helical in shape, and they are sometimes cut short and sold as “unicorn horns.” However, they have no particular magical value. Narwhals are found in cold northern seas. They are not particularly aggressive.</p>

<p>These creatures can be up to 60 feet long. They prey on giant squid. Sperm whales can emit an invisible focused beam of sound 5’ wide up to a 50’ range underwater. This blast of sound disorients target creatures, leaving them effectively stunned for 1d4 rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is required, but a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray is allowed to resist. A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per round, instead of biting.</p>

<p>A wight’s appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of a human. Wights do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<p>If a wight touches (or is touched by) a living creature, that living creature suffers one level of&nbsp;<strong>energy drain</strong>&nbsp;(as described in the&nbsp;<strong>Encounter</strong>&nbsp;section). No saving throw is allowed. Striking a wight with a weapon does not count as “touching” it.</p>
<p>Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight by the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). Wight spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death.</p>
<p>Like all undead, wights may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>charm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;magics. Wights are harmed only by silver or magical weapons, and take only half damage from burning oil.</p>

<p>Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning. They prefer to surround and flank a foe when they can.</p>
<p>Dire wolves are efficient pack hunters that will kill anything they can catch. Dire wolves are generally mottled gray or black, about 9 feet long and weighing some 800 pounds.</p>

<p>Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature’s AC or combat abilities but only reflects the shape it had in life.</p>
<p>Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>charm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;magics. Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.</p>

<p>A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.</p>
<p>Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.</p>
<p>Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. Any living creature hit by the wyvern’s stinger must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack or when landing.</p>
<p>If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped.</p>

<p>If disturbed, a patch of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. Each patch covers from 10 to 25 square feet; several patches may grow adjacent to each other, and will appear to be a single patch in this case. Each patch can emit a cloud of spores once per day. All within 10 feet of the mold will be affected by the spores and must save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray or take 1d8 points of damage per round for 6 rounds. Sunlight renders yellow mold dormant.</p>

<p>Zombies are the&nbsp;<strong>undead</strong>&nbsp;corpses of humanoid creatures. They are deathly slow, but they move silently, are very strong and must be literally hacked to pieces to “kill” them. They take only half damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). A zombie never has Initiative and always acts last in any given round. Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>charm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;magics. As they are mindless, no form of mind reading is of any use against them. Zombies never fail morale checks, and thus always fight until destroyed.</p>
